**Title**: Analysis, Detection and Mitigation of Cache Pollution Attack and Interest Flooding Attack in Named Data Networking

**Supervisor**: Dr. Shashank Srivastava

Analyzed the various types of cache pollution and interest flooding attacks in Named Data Networking (NDN) based computer networks, as well as the existing related work to mitigate such attacks. 
Simulated the attacks and mitigation strategies using ndnSIM (NS-3 based NDN simulator) and published the results. 
Proposed an improved attack mitigation strategy/algorithm and compared its efficacy against the existing solutions.
